3. Select "More" and then "Export chat".
4. Choose whether you want to export the chat with or without media (photos, videos, etc.).

## Prep

1. Unzip the file: Right-click on the ZIP file and select "Extract All" or "Unzip" (the exact option may vary depending on your device and operating system).
2. Find the text file: Inside the unzipped folder, look for a file with a .txt extension (usually named "chat.txt" or something similar).
3. Share the text file: Copy and paste the contents of the text file into a message, and I'll receive it.

## Running

After adjusting the word list, you can configure how many lines it looks at, currently it slices the timestamp, and there are some hardcoded words that were removed.

```shell
poetry install
## Run this as part of the main.py `nltk.download('stopwords')`
poetry run python main.py
```
